This is a simple project to demonstrate my general engineering capability using TypeScript and Node.js.
The approach it to write simple types/method to meet the requirements, then using Jest as a framework I design
the the unit test scenario base from the expected behavior from each requirements. The package only includes
configuration for the TypeScript and Jest, since I don't think that we need to compile the application for the
user input.

To run the script just run this command using a terminal: "npm test".
